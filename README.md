# ECG Sleep Staging
This page provides the preprocessing codes and the model weights for ECG-based sleep staging as described in [1]. The network has been trained and validated on the MGH dataset. The codes require the PhysioNet Cardiovascular Signal Toolbox and The WFDB Software Package. The test codes use the MIT-BIH Polysomnographic Database. These datasets and toolboxes are available from PhysioNet.
